# Server-Side Rendering

This repository contains code for server-side rendering. Server-side rendering (SSR) is a technique used in web development to render web pages on the server before sending them to the client. This approach offers several benefits, including improved performance, better SEO, and enhanced user experience.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies by running `npm install`.
3. Configure the server-side rendering settings according to your requirements.
4. Start the server by running `npm start`.
5. Access the rendered web pages by navigating to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.
